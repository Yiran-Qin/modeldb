    Congratulations on creating <a href="/{{accession_number}}">Model {{accession_number}}</a>.
    Please note that models are <i>private</i> by default. To make this model public, go to the
    model page using your read-write access code and select the "make public" option. It will then
    be reviewed by a curator who may or may not contact you before making the model public.
</p>
<p>
    In the meantime, you may access this model using either the read-write access code (to make
    changes) or the read access code. Feel free to share the read access code with your paper
    reviewers if you are uploading prior to publication.

    <b>Current development status:</b>
    The file has been created in the folder for private model zips, but no database entry
    has been created, nor is there the ability to view private models. There is also no
    validation.
