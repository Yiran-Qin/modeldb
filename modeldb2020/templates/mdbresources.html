                                        Electron tomography is similar in concept to medical imaging techniques like CAT
                                        scans and MRI in that it derives a 3D volume from a series of 2D projections
                                        through a structure. In this case, the structures are contained in sections
                                        prepared for electron microscopy which are tilted through a limited angular
                                        range. Many of the data sets in the CCDB come from studies of the nervous
                                        system, although the CCDB is not restricted to neuronal information.

                                        Understanding the brain function requires integration of diverse information from the level of molecule to the level of neuronal networks.
                                        However, the huge amount of information is making it almost impossible for any individual researcher
                                        to construct an integrated view of the brain. To solve this problem requires to make useful neuroinformatics
                                        tools for information storing, maintenance and sharing. In the present study, we constructed an integrated
                                        system for vision neuroscience named Visiome Environment as a test bed for useful neuroinformatics tools.

                                        supports both
                                        quantitative and qualitative pathway models. The CellML 1.0
                                        Specification defines any model which defines the change in the concentration of
                                        a chemical species involved in a reaction, as a quantitative pathway model. Here
                                        we adapt that definition to include both pathway and electrophysiological
                                        models.  CellML has plans to build a simulator to execute CellML models which are now just

                                        is multi-agency initiative to construct databases of neuroscience data, and to provide tools for searching
                                        and retrieving that data to support research, teaching and education of the public into normal and abnormal
                                        functions of the nervous system.
                                        This program was initiated in 1993, and has grown to the point where it presently supports 37 separate
                                        projects. The data generated and archived by those projects comes from all levels of brain organization,
                                        from many different methodologies, and many different species. The overall aim of the Human Brain Project
                                        is to enable users to access and integrate all of this information to support greater use of the data and
                                        better insights into brain function.  Toward that goal this Human Brain Project Database is designed to
                                        assist the user in accessing the information contained in the current projects and other similar projects
                                        on the web. It provides not only simple lists of the different projects, but also advanced tools for complex
                                        searches that will enable the user to identify and extract different types of data distributed within
                                        the different projects.

                                        effort aimed at understanding, predicting and controlling chemical reactions used in
                                        processing of inorganic and polymeric thin films. Modelling and experiment are intertwined
                                        to develop new insights to the behavior of these materials under a wide range of conditions,
                                        and to use these insights to enhance discovery as well as applications. We are involved in
                                        the development of both simulation algorithms and experimental probes.
                    
                                        One of our codes - the Chemical Kinetics Simulator program, CKS for short - is available for
                                        downloading. It is a scientific software tool developed by chemists in the kinetics simulation
                                        project that provides the bench scientist with an easy-to-use, rapid, interactive method for the
                                        accurate simulation of chemical reactions. The package includes extensive documentation and
                                        is available in versions for OS/2 2.x and higher, Apple Macintosh and Power Macintosh, and
                                        Microsoft Windows 3.1/Windows 95/Windows NT.
                    
                                        Simulations are an environmentally responsible component of research and development programs.
                                        Realistic, reliable chemical models allow scientists and engineers to minimize the amount of
                                        physical experimentation used for a study, and avoid unnecessary generation of hazardous waste -
                                        CKS is particularly useful for this purpose.
